        <p>There are billions of devices connected to the Internet, and hundreds of different <em>kinds</em> of devices:
            laptops, tablets, phones, refrigerators, handheld credit card readers, and so on. How do they all know how
            to find and talk to each other? <strong>Protocols</strong> (standards) ensure that the variety of devices
            interact with each other smoothly.</p>
        <p>There are a <em>lot</em> of protocols! The Internet was designed with several layers of <em>abstraction</em>
            that sort the protocols according to what part of the process they support. </p>


        <h3>Internet Abstraction Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>This <em>hierarchy of abstractions</em> manages the complexity of the Internet by hiding the details of lower
            levels of the system. The highest level of abstraction includes the most general features of the Internet
            that have to work the same across all devices. At lowers levels of abstraction, things get more
            device-specific. </p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Layer Protocols</strong> are the highest level of abstraction because they<em>
                        manage how data is interpreted and displayed</em> to users. These protocols <em>give meaning to
                        the bits</em> sent by lower-level protocols; user and server computers must agree on what the
                    bits mean, and application protocols (like HTTP) offer this.</li>
                <div class="endnote">
                    Browsers use <a
                        href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-reliable-communication/1-what-is-internet.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">HTTP</a>
                    (HyperText Transfer Protocol) to interpret HTML instructions for page formatting. <a
                        href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-reliable-communication/3-address-hierarchy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">DNS</a>
                    (Domain Name System) converts user-friendly web addresses into IP addresses. Your email inbox may
                    use SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) to read
                    email.
                </div>
                <li><strong>Transport Layer Protocols</strong> manage the <em>breakdown of a message into packets</em>
                    to be transmitted by lower level protocols and also the <em>reconstruction of the message from the
                        packets</em> upon arrival.</li>
                <div class="endnote">
                    <a
                        href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/2-tcp.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">TCP</a>
                    (Transmission Control Protocol) <em>simulates</em> a reliable, long-term connection between two
                    computers by only displaying data once all packets have arrived. When speed is more important than
                    accuracy, people use UDP (User Datagram Protocol), such as for real-time video streaming, where one
                    missed packet doesn't matter much.
                </div>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Internet Layer Protocols</strong> <em>manage the pathways that the data packets travel</em>
                    across networks. These protocols treat the Internet like one large network even though the physical
                    reality on the lower level is one of many tiny subnetworks.</li>
                <div class="endnote">
                    Every device on the Internet needs an IP address so other devices can find it. <a
                        href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/1-ip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">IP</a>
                    (Internet Protocol) addresses are upgrading from IPv4 to IPv6. Routers use Internet layer protocols
                    to detect and work around network congestion.
                </div>
                <li><strong>Network Interface Hardware</strong> (Link Layer): All Internet devices connect through a
                    <em>physical interface that uses a protocol to manage the connection</em> to the local network.
                    These local protocols are the least abstract because they deal directly with your physical hardware.
                </li>
                <div class="endnote">
                    You may connect to the Internet with an <em>Ethernet</em> cable or perhaps a <em>WiFi</em> radio
                    antenna inside the case of your computer. Either connects computers to a local network router which
                    then connects to an Internet provider. Cell phones use a longer-range <em>cellular</em> connection
                    to a phone carrier.
                </div>
            </ul>
            <p>All four of these levels include more protocols than listed here.</p>
        </div>


        <h3>Open Protocols</h3>
        <p>These are all <strong>open standards</strong>: anyone can look up a protocol and code with it to make new
            hardware or software without permission. The Internet is probably the largest and most complicated artifact
            in human history, and it relies on <strong>cooperation</strong>. Despite some governments' attempts to
            censor the net, the big picture is one of strong cooperative spirit.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
            Just think...
            <ul>
                <li>Your T-Mobile cell phone can talk to your friend's Verizon phone.</li>
                <li>You can send email to someone in a country that's considered an enemy of your country (from the US
                    to Iran, for example).</li>
                <li>An engineer at Microsoft can read a web page at Apple even though their companies are competitors.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before the Internet, there were several different network protocols that were secrets belonging to
                particular manufacturers. So if you had a particular brand of computer or router, it could talk only to
                other computers of the same brand.</p>
