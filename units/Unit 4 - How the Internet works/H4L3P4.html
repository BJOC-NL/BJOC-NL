            <p><strong>Op deze pagina,</strong> you will learn about a commonly used method of cryptography that is more
                secure. </p>
        </div>

        <p>The fundamental problem that cryptography is trying to solve is how to get a message to your friend that
            can't be intercepted by your enemies. Symmetric encryption has a fundamental weakness: the encryption key is
            itself a message that needs to be send to your friend but not intercepted by your enemy. </p>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">
            The public key idea was invented and first published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976. It
            turns out that it had been invented earlier but kept secret by governments.
        </div>
        <p><em>Public key cryptography</em> is a mathematical technique to avoid the need to communicate a secret key
            from one person to another. Instead, each person has <em>two</em> keys: a private key known only to that
            person and a public key that everyone in the world is allowed to know. If Bob wants to send Alice a secret
            message, he encrypts it with Alice's public key. Then no one but Alice can decrypt it. Only her private key
            can undo the encryption, and no one <em>can figure out</em> the private key from the public key. </p>

                <li>It may seem incredible that Alice can make her encryption key public and still no one except her can
                    decrypt her message. The public key method relies on some mathematics and on some limitations on the
                    speed of current computers. Read "Secrecy Changes Forever" (<a

            <div id="hint-digital-signatures" class="collapse">That's no good for secret messages (why not?), but it's
                useful for <strong>digital signatures</strong>. I use my private key to encrypt a message; you use my
                public key to decrypt it. If you get a meaningful message as the result, that proves that the message
                was encrypted with my private key. (If I want both secrecy and digital signing, I encrypt the message
                with my private key to sign it, then encrypt the encrypted result <em>again</em> with your public key to
                keep it secret. You decrypt it twice, first with your private key and then with my public key.) This is
                a nice example of <em>composition of functions:</em> the output from the first encryption is the input
                to the second encryption. </div>

        <h3>Secure HTTP</h3>
        <p>Secure HTTP connections (those that use <strong>https://</strong> instead of <strong>http://</strong>) use a
            protocol called <em>Transport Layer Security</em> (TLS) or maybe an older version called <em>Secure Sockets
                Layer</em> (SSL). Both are based on public key cryptography. With SSL/TLS, the site you are visiting
            sends its public key, and your browser uses it to encrypt the information you send. </p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <p><strong>SSL/TLS</strong> (secure sockets layer/transport layer security) is the standard used for
                cryptographically secured information transfer on the Internet. </p>

                <p>In order to work properly, a cryptographic function has to be easy for the private key holder to
                    invert, but hard for anyone else to invert. How do we know what "hard" means? For example, current
                    cryptographic methods rely on the difficulty of finding prime factors of very large numbers. There's
                    no <em>proof</em> that someone won't come up with a fast way to do that, but people are pretty
                    confident about it because the problem has been well studied by many mathematicians. (On the other
                    hand, when <em>quantum computers</em> become practical, factorization <em>will</em> be easy, and new
                    cryptographic methods will be needed.)</p>
                <p>What makes it possible for mathematicians to study the difficulty of breaking Internet cryptography
                    is that the method used&mdash;the cryptographic function&mdash;is openly published. This may seem
                    strange; if you want to keep secrets, shouldn't you keep the technique secret, too? But secret
                    algorithms can have weaknesses that go undiscovered until some bad guy exploits them. Open standards
                    allow an algorithm to be studied <em>before</em> it is used in practice. </p>

        <h3>Certificate Authorities</h3>
        <div class="vocabBig">
            <p><strong>Certificate authorities</strong> issue digital certificates that verify who owns the encryption
                keys used for secured communications. </p>
        </div>
        <p>Public key cryptography doesn't solve all the problems, because an eavesdropper (say, Eve) might publish a
            fake public key pretending to be Alice. Then Bob might accidentally encrypt their message for Alice using
            the Eve's fake key, and then the Eve can read the message. In practice, this is partly fixed by relying on
            trusted third parties, called <em>Certificate Authorities</em>, to certify public keys. In your browser's
            security options you can see all of the Certificate Authorities that it trusts. </p>
        <div class="endnote">But this just pushes the problem back a layer. How does the Certificate Authorities know
            that you are who you say you are? The problem is a little bit like how your bank knows that you who you say
            you are when you call them on the phone. Namely, they ask you questions for which they hope only you know
            the answer. </div>
