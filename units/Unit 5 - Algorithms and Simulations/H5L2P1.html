        <h2>Why Use Models and Simulations?</h2>

        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will explore how models and simulations can be used to gain insight
                into
                real world phenomena.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn why models and simulations are used instead of real world
                experiments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <p>A <strong>model</strong> is a computer representation of an object (or system of objects) in the real
                world.
                For example, you can have a model of an airplane or a highway.</p>
            <p>A <strong>simulation</strong> is an algorithm that uses models to see what will happen over time under
                certain conditions. For example, if you <em>model</em> an airplane, you might <em>simulate</em> wind
                hitting
                it.</p>

            Models and simulations are computer representations of complex phenomena in the real world. They are used to
            explain or predict real life occurrences. There are many reasons to use computer simulations rather than
            real
            world experiments:
            <ul>
                <li>Experimenting in the real world may be <strong>expensive</strong>. For example, a new design for an
                    airplane might fall apart in strong winds. Using a computer to model the shape of the airplane and
                    to
                    simulate the wind behavior can eliminate some bad designs before building a real airplane.</li>
                <li>Experimenting in the real world may be <strong>time-consuming</strong>, such as testing the effects
                    of a
                    genetic mutation in a species across generations.</li>
                <li>Experimenting in the real world may be <strong>dangerous</strong>, such as testing whether a nuclear
                    reactor will survive an earthquake.</li>
                <li>Experimenting in the real world may be <strong>unethical</strong>, such as giving a population a
                    disease
                    to test how fast it spreads.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Computer models rarely capture the full complexity of real situations. For example, models that scientists
            use to
            predict the impact of global climate change have to account for hundreds of interconnected factors such as
            wind
            patterns, the course of rivers, geological fault lines that cause earthquakes, and interactions of local
            plants
            and animals. It would be impossible to include all real interdependent factors in a model. So, researchers
            make
            <em>simplifying assumptions</em> in their models.</p>
        <p>Researchers may use an <em>iterative design process</em>, starting with a very simple model and refining that
            model based on their past experiences to make it more realistic for the next simulation. Highly detailed
            models
            may push the limits of current computer speeds. So, researchers may have to limit the complexity of the
            model.
            Complex models and simulations depend on abstractions (simplifications) to avoid the many details of real
            world
            phenomena.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>As a class, come up with some examples of complex real life phenomena for which it would be
                    impractical,
                    impossible, dangerous, or unethical to conduct real world experiments.</li>
                <li>Explain how modeling and simulations may help with our understanding of these phenomena. What are
                    some
                    pros and cons of using computers to explore these situations?</li>
