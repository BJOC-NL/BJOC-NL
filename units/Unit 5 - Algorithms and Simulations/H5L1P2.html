        <p>When searching for an item in <em>unsorted</em> data, you have to check every item until you find the value
            you
            are looking for.</p>

                    a
                    number in an unsorted list or reports "Not In List" (or NIL, if you like) if the number is not in
                    the

        <h3>Searching in Sorted Data</h3>
        <p>If you are searching for a number in a <em>sorted</em> list, you have more information. Suppose you have a
            sorted
            list and you want to locate the position of a number.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Typically, sorted lists are from lowest to highest. You'll create a block that sorts a list
            of
            numbers in Unit 8, <a

                our
                number is in the first or last half of the list. That would save time.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> This feels a lot like the guessing game we built&mdash;I pick a number and the
                computer tries to guess it by splitting the list in half with each guess.</div>

                <span>Alphie: </span> But in that one, the computer guessed a number that we picked. Now we want it to
                find
                a number in a list and report its position. It should work like this:<br />

            <div><span>Betsy: </span> Yes, but it still <em>feels</em> the same. It should have the same guts as the
