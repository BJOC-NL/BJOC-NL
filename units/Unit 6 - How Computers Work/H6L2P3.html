        <p>As you know, numbers show up everywhere in computer algorithms&mdash;even if numbers aren't the topic. For
            example, the user may be interested in a picture, but that picture is an abstraction over numbers. Numbers
            are also used to find a specific item in a list. Over the next several pages, you'll look more closely at
            numbers inside the computer.</p>

        <h3>Fixed Width Computer Hardware</h3>
        <div class="vocabBig">
            <p><strong>width</strong>: the number of bits that a CPU processes at a time</p>
            <p><strong>word</strong>: a binary sequence of that many bits</p>
        </div>
        <p>So why did Snap<em>!</em> display 20! in ordinary whole number representation but 30! in scientific notation?
            Every computer model is designed with a certain<strong> width</strong>, the number of bits that the
            processor reads from memory or writes into memory at a time. That number of bits is called a
            <strong>word</strong>. As of 2016, most new computers are 64 bits wide. The first microcomputer, sold in
            1971, was four bits wide!</p>
        <div class="endnote">If you got an answer in scientific notation for 20!, you're using a 32-bit computer.</div>
        <p>A 64-bit word represents 2<sup>64</sup> different values. We use half for negative numbers, one for zero, and
            the rest for positives. Half of 2<sup>64</sup> (which is 2<sup>63</sup> = 9,223,372,036,854,775,808) is
            about 9 &times; 10<sup>18</sup>. That means that the 19 digits of 20! just barely fit in a 64-bit word. But
            the 33 digits of 30! don't. So the computer hardware reports an <em>overflow</em> error, and Snap<em>!</em>
            computes an approximation.</p>
        <div class="endnote"> <a href="#hint-power-2" data-toggle="collapse">Are processor widths always powers of
                two?</a>
            <div id="hint-power-2" class="collapse">Processor widths don't have to be a power of two. Some old
                computers&mdash;the kind you see in old movies that filled a large room&mdash;used 12-bit, 36-bit, and
                60-bit words. But modern personal computers started at 8 bits and the widths have been doubling with
                each new generation.</div>

        <h3>Bignums</h3>
        <div class="sidenote"> A multiple-word integer is called a <strong>bignum</strong>. </div>
        <p>Why can't programming languages just use more than one word to represent an integer? They can. It's just that
            a single machine language instruction can only add one-word numbers. A programming language must work a
            little harder to make addition work with multiple-word values. Not all languages do this, but the
            highest-level languages do. </p>

                        href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/index.html" target="_blank">Scheme</a>.
                    You can learn it from the free, online book <a

            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="takeNote">The design of a programming language isn't just a question of taste; it can be a matter of
            life and death. Between 1985 and 1987, a therapeutic X-ray machine killed four patients and seriously
            injured two more because of several bugs in its software; one of the bugs was that a counter that was kept
            in an eight-bit-wide variable would reach its maximum value of 127 and then <em>overflow</em> to zero
            instead of 128. When the variable was zero, an important safety check was not performed. This would not have
            happened if the software had been written in a better programming language.</div>
