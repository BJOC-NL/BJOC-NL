        <h2>Abstractie Binnen de Computer</h2>
        <p>In Unit 4 <a
                href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/3-open-protocols.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">A
                Hierarchy of Open Protocols</a>, you saw that the Internet software is arranged in several levels of
            abstraction, with application programs (like your email program) at the highest level and network hardware
            protocols such as WiFi and Ethernet at the lowest level. Recall that <em>higher</em> levels are closer to
            what users want to be thinking about; lower levels are closer to the way machines work. </p>
        <p>Like the Internet, the way a computer works on the inside also has levels of abstraction.</p>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will learn about the levels of abstraction in computer software and
                hardware.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn get an overview of three groups (<em>domains</em>) of
                levels of abstraction.</p>
        </div>
        <p>There are a lot of levels of abstraction in how computers work. Here they are organized into three
            overarching domains:</p> <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/hardware-abstraction.png"
            alt="Geen Afbeelding" />
        <div class="endnote">Different people might draw this diagram slightly differently, so don't try to memorize all
            the levels. The key abstraction levels to remember are software, digital computer hardware, and underlying
            analog circuit components.</div>
        <h3>Software Domain</h3>
        <p> The programs you write and use are software, but underneath these programs is more software that helps them
            work. In this lab, we'll look at four layers of abstraction in the software domain: <ul>
                <li><strong>applications</strong> that you write and use</li>
                <li><strong>programing languages</strong> that are used to write them</li>
                <li><strong>libraries</strong> of useful functions that hide messy details</li>
                <li><strong>operating systems</strong> that interface with the hardware</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Software is an <em>abstraction</em>&mdash;a way of thinking about the computer without thinking about how it
            works.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Similarly, an automobile driver is operating at a high level of abstraction when using the
            brake pedal. As long as the engineers and mechanics designed and built the car right, drivers don't need to
            know the details about <em>how</em> the brake system works&mdash;they just use it at a high level.</div>

        </div>
        <h3>Digital Domain</h3>
        <p> In the software domain, each level of abstraction is a different piece of software, but the levels of
            abstraction in the digital domain are different ways of thinking about the same physical object. The
            circuitry inside a computer is complicated, and to make building it possible, engineers think about it at
            several different levels of abstraction: <ul>
                <li>The <strong>architecture</strong> is the instructions that software can send that the hardware will
                    understand.</li>
                <li>The computer has <strong>components</strong> (such as memory, processors, video cards, etc.) that
                    implement the architecture.</li>
                <li>Those components are built out of <strong>integrated circuits (chips)</strong>, which are the black
                    rectangles that you can see on this circuit board.</li>
                <li>Those integrated circuits are designed around <strong>logic gates</strong>, the fundamental building
                    blocks that implement Boolean functions.</li>
                <div class="endnote"> You learned about Boolean functions in <a

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Analog Domain</h3>
        <p>Logic gates, which are the lowest abstraction level of the digital domain, operate on ones and zeros. In
            physical reality, those logic gates are built out of <strong>transistors</strong>, a type of circuit
            component. Transitors aren't like light switches that are either on or off. There can be in-between values
            (like "only 23% on"). So, electrical engineers have to think about the laws of electronics to design digital
            circuits so that in-between values don't happen.</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>analog</strong> vs. <strong>digital</strong>
            <p>Digital and analog are opposites. <strong>Digital</strong> means information that is represented as
                <em>ones and zeros</em>. <strong>Analog</strong> means information that is represented by signals that
                <em>vary continuously</em> (that is, including in-between values).</p>
