    <h2>Binary Sequences</h2>
    <div class="learn">
        <p><strong>Op deze pagina,</strong> you will learn more about how information is represented inside the computer
            as sequences of bits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sidenote">In many programming languages there's a convention that every text string ends with a
        <em>null</em> byte, in which all eight bits are zero, a code that's reserved for this purpose. So our
        "<code>Welcome...</code>" string might actually occupy 44 bytes.</div>
    <p>So far we've been working with small chunks of data, from Boolean values (one bit) to characters (eight bits).
        But of course some information in your computer or smartphone is much bigger than that. For starters, characters
        aren't generally used one at a time; they're used in <em>text strings</em> such as "<code>Welcome to the Beauty
            and Joy of Computing.</code>" These 43 characters occupy 43 bytes of computer memory. But the real champion
        users of space are media files: pictures, sounds (mostly music), and video.</p>
    <p>If we could see inside the memory's bits, a section of the memory might look something like this:</p>
    <div class="blockquote">
        <code class="break">
            01000001001000000111001101101101011000010111001001110100001000000111000001101000011011110110111001100101001011000010000001101100011010010110101101100101001000000111100101101111011101010111001000100000011011000110000101110000011101000110111101110000001000000110111101110010001000000110010001100101011100110110101101110100011011110111000000100000011000110110111101101101011100000111010101110100011001010111001000101100001000000110001101100001011011100
    </div>
    <div class="vocab">
        <p>A <strong>binary sequence</strong> (also called a <em>bitstream</em>) is a string of ones and zeros. </p>
    </div>
    <p>That shows just 449 bits. A 16GB cell phone has sixteen gigabytes (about 16 billion bytes) of storage, each byte
        containing 8 bits. That's 128,000,000,000 bits. Printed on paper as ones and zeros, the 16 GB phone's memory
        would take nearly 40,000,000 pages! The information in storage—whether it is a text message, a photograph, a
        song, a computer program, or a list of phone numbers—looks just the same, a sequence of bits that are either On
        or Off (one or zero).</p>

    <p>"Binary sequence" is a very broad category, and often, several layers of abstraction are built on it. For
        example, you can include a picture in an email or text message, in which case, the <em>message</em> includes a
        <em>picture</em>, which is a kind of <em>file</em>, which is a kind of <em>bitstream</em>.</p>

        <p>So if pictures, music, and words all look the same in memory—all binary sequences—how can the computer tell
            what any chunk of memory actually is? For example, should the sequence 01000001 be interpreted as the number
            65, the letter A, a rather dark shade of red, or something else?</p>
        <p>The meaning of a sequence of bits depends on the context in which it is used. What exactly do we mean by
            "context"? How does a programming language know whether to interpret a bit sequence as an integer, a
            picture, a string of characters, an instruction, or something else? There's always <em>another</em> bit
            sequence somewhere that encodes the <strong>data type</strong> of the bit sequence.</p>

        <a href="#hint-data-types" data-toggle="collapse">But
            different languages use data types differently.</a>
        <div id="hint-data-types" class="collapse">
            <p>
                In high-level languages, that data type code is attached to the value itself. In lower-level languages,
                when you make a variable, you have to say what type of value it will contain, and the data type is
                attached to the <em>variable</em>, so you can't get exact answers when the values are integers and also
                be able to handle non-integer values of the same variable. So instead of seeing: <br />

                you see things like:<br />

            <p>Snap<em>!</em> has strengths that many programming languages do not, and it's very likely that your
                <em>next</em> year's computer science class will use one of those other languages. For example, if you
                take the AP Computer Science A course, you will use Java.</p>

                Look inside the <code>translate text to binary sequence</code> and <code>translate binary sequence to
                    text</code> reporters. <strong>Describe how these two reporters work.</strong> There are several

                <ul>
                    <li><code>pack 8-bit byte</code> takes a binary sequence of 8 bits or less and add enough zeros to
                        the front to make a whole byte. How is this used?</li>
                    <li><code>translate decimal to binary</code> takes a decimal value (a normal number) as input and
                        translates it to the binary representation of that number. This block uses recursion. Why is
                        recursion helpful here?</li>
                    <li><code>translate text to Unicode list</code> takes a text string and outputs a list of each
