            <p>The <strong>transistor</strong> is the fundamental building block of electronic circuits, where they are
                used
                as on/off switches.</p>

        <p>You've learned that a wire can either have a voltage or not have a voltage on it. The reality is more
            complicated. The on-or-off picture of a wire, a transistor, or a logic gate output is a
            simplification&mdash;an
            abstraction. </p>
        <img class="imageLeft" height="220" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/transistor-curve.png" alt="Geen Afbeelding" />
        <p>This is a rough graph of the actual input-output behavior of a transistor. Don't worry about the details;
            just
            notice the two blue <em>flat</em> parts of the graph.
            Within the "cutoff" region, small changes to the input voltage do not change the output voltage at all; the
            output is always <em>zero</em> volts. Likewise within the "saturation" region, small input changes hardly
            impact
            output voltage; the output is interpreted as a <em>one</em>. This is how transistors are used as
            <em>switches</em> in a computer.</p>
        <p>Transistors are versatile devices. When used in the middle, linear (pink) part of the graph, they're
            <em>amplifiers</em>; a small variation in input voltage produces a large variation in output voltage. That's
            how
            they're used to play music in a stereo. </p>
        <div class="endnote" style="overflow: hidden;">
            <a href="#hint-chart-labels" data-toggle="collapse">Why are they called "cutoff,"
                "linear,"
                and "saturation"?</a>
            <div id="hint-chart-labels" class="collapse">The lower region of the curve is called "cutoff" because the
                transistor's output is <em>cut off</em> (the output is zero) for any input in that region. The upper
                region
                is called "saturation" because, like a sponge that can't get any wetter, the transistor can't give more
                output no matter how big the input. The central region is called "linear" because it behaves like a
                linear
                (straight) function.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="endnote">The transistor was invented in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley
            at
            Bell Laboratories, also the home of Unix. The inventors were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for
            this
            work.</div>

        <div class="takeNote">The digital domain is not a law of nature; circuit designers have to work at ensuring that
            each wire in a circuit is always either fully on or fully off. The digital domain is an abstraction.</div>

            <div id="hint-digital-abstraction" class="collapse">
                <p>The flatness of the output at the two extremes is important because there <em>will</em> be small
                    changes
                    in the input. Electrical circuits have "noise," undesired changes in voltages, for reasons from the
                    transistors getting hot to loose connections on the circuit board to cosmic rays. This is why
                    computers
                    use zeros and ones: a transistor has two flat regions in its input-output curve.</p>
                <p>But the flatness of the saturated region is only approximate, and it depends on how the transistor is
                    connected to the rest of the circuit. One example of a potential problem is <em>fanout,</em> the
                    number
                    of transistor inputs to which one transistor's output is connected. Beyond a certain number (it
                    depends
                    on the particular transistor type, but certainly ten inputs would be too many), the output voltage
                    is
                    reduced to the point that those inputs might not be sure whether they're getting a zero or a one.
                </p>
                <p>The way a transistor really works depends on quantum physics. (We're not talking about <em>quantum
                        computers;</em> plain old computer circuits are based on quantum effects also.) To learn more
                    about
                    analog-domain circuit design and what's inside a transistor, take an Electrical Engineering course.
