    <h2>The Analog Domain: Transistors</h2>
    <div class="todo">
        <p>EK 2.2.3I Hardware is built using multiple levels of abstractions, such as transistors, logic gates, chips,
            memory, motherboards, special purposes cards, and storage devices.</p>

    <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll learn about the transistors that implement logic gates.
    </div>
    <div class="sidenote">
        <p>The <strong>transistor</strong> is the fundamental building block of electronic circuits, where they are used
            as on/off switches.</p>

    <p>You've learned that a wire can either have a voltage or not have a voltage on it. The reality is more
        complicated. The on-or-off picture of a wire, a transistor, or a logic gate output is a simplification&mdash;an
        abstraction. </p>

    <p>This is a rough graph of the actual input-output behavior of a transistor. Don't worry about the details; just
        notice the two blue <em>flat</em> parts of the graph.
        <!--With a very small input (cutoff) or a very large input (saturation), the output is relatively unchanged by small variations.-->
        Within the "cutoff" region, small changes to the input voltage do not change the output voltage at all; the
        output is always <em>zero</em> volts. Likewise within the "saturation" region, small input changes hardly impact
        output voltage; the output is interpreted as a <em>one</em>. This is how transistors are used as
        <em>switches</em> in a computer.</p>
    <p>Transistors are versatile devices. When used in the middle, linear (pink) part of the graph, they're
        <em>amplifiers</em>; a small variation in input voltage produces a large variation in output voltage. That's how
        they're used to play music in a stereo. </p>

            and "saturation"?</a>
        <div id="hint-chart-labels" class="collapse">The lower region of the curve is called "cutoff" because the
            transistor's output is <em>cut off</em> (the output is zero) for any input in that region. The upper region
            is called "saturation" because, like a sponge that can't get any wetter, the transistor can't give more
            output no matter how big the input. The central region is called "linear" because it behaves like a linear
            (straight) function.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="endnote">The transistor was invented in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at
        Bell Laboratories, also the home of Unix. The inventors were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for this
        work.</div>

    <div class="takeNote">The digital domain is not a law of nature; circuit designers have to work at ensuring that
        each wire in a circuit is always either fully on or fully off. The digital domain is an abstraction.</div>

        <div id="hint-digital-abstraction" class="collapse">
            <p>The flatness of the output at the two extremes is important because there <em>will</em> be small changes
                in the input. Electrical circuits have "noise," undesired changes in voltages, for reasons from the
                transistors getting hot to loose connections on the circuit board to cosmic rays. This is why computers
                use zeros and ones: a transistor has two flat regions in its input-output curve.</p>
            <p>But the flatness of the saturated region is only approximate, and it depends on how the transistor is
                connected to the rest of the circuit. One example of a potential problem is <em>fanout,</em> the number
                of transistor inputs to which one transistor's output is connected. Beyond a certain number (it depends
                on the particular transistor type, but certainly ten inputs would be too many), the output voltage is
                reduced to the point that those inputs might not be sure whether they're getting a zero or a one.</p>
            <p>The way a transistor really works depends on quantum physics. (We're not talking about <em>quantum
                    computers;</em> plain old computer circuits are based on quantum effects also.) To learn more about
                analog-domain circuit design and what's inside a transistor, take an Electrical Engineering course.</p>
