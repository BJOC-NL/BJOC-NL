                I find it odd that we have two images from the TIF in this pink box. Why not use this? --MF,

                ST- The image proposed is identical to what we have in FYTD#7 and in the two debugging videos. The
                animations in the pink box are not the same as in the TIF. The TIF versions involve an animated
                parameter guiding the changing rotations of the smaller versions of the polygons. Whereas the pink box
                versions do not have any changing rotations. So I would vote against the change.
            </p>
            <p>My concern is that these images don't look like what the students so on this page. They don't make these
                images. Right? We don't have to resolve this now though. We can leave this for later. :) --MF, 3/22/18

    <h3>Using Abstraction to Nest Triangles</h3>
    <p>Does all this copying and pasting of code feel awkward to you? You know a better way: <em>abstraction</em>. In
        Unit 1 you used a <code>pinwheel</code> block to implement <code>asterisk</code> and <code>polygon</code>,
        rather than copying the code. Here, you can use a block to manage the abstraction too, but in this case, we want
        very similar code (a smaller triangle) nested inside, so we will actually <em>use the same block inside
            itself</em>.</p>

    <div class="forYouToDo">
        <ol start="9">
            <li>
                Create a <code>nested triangle</code> block.
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        Design the block with one input, <var>size</var>. For now, leave out the part about changing
                        colors.<br />

                        Use your first unnamed triangle script from problem 1 as a model. But add one condition: draw
                        the triangle only if it's big enough:<br />

                    </li>
                    <li>Click the "Apply" button in the Block Editor so that the block appears in the palette on the
                        left.</li>
                    <li><strong>Try out this block</strong> giving at least the inputs 9, 18, 20 and 100 to make sure it

            <li>
                In problem #4, you dragged a copy of the script between the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code>
                blocks. You can do a similar thing with your <em>block</em>.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        From the palette, drag a copy of that <code>nested triangle</code> block into the editor and
                        insert it <em>in</em> the definition of <code>nested triangle</code> between the
                        <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks. Make its <var>size</var> input half the current
                        value of <var>size</var>.<br />
